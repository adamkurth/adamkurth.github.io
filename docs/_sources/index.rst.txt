        <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">Hello, my name is Adam Kurth. As a currrent Master's student at Arizona State University, my academic interests are deeply rooted in biostatistics, high-throughput imaging data, decisions and their role in predictive modeling, propensity scoring matching, longitudinal studies, and survival analysis.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">I am passionate about the potential of statistics to improve medical imaging and diagnostics, an area where I aim to make significant contributions. I am also interested in the applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence in the field of biostatistics.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">As a graduate student, I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of research projects, including the development of supervised and unsupervised NLP classification models for NASA, statistical computing projects, and deep learning classification software for crystallography imaging data.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">Feel free to explore my website to learn more about my research and professional journey. If you have any questions or if you'd like to discuss potential collaborations, please do not hesitate to reach out through the <a href="contact.html">contact</a> page.</p>
