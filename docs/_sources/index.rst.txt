        <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">Hello, my name is Adam Kurth. I am an incoming Ph.D. student in Biostatistics at Brown University and a recent graduate of Arizona State University, where I earned both my B.S. in Mathematics (Statistics) and M.S. in Statistics through the accelerated 4+1 program.</p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">My academic and research interests center around Bayesian statistics, causal inference, predictive modeling, and uncertainty quantification. I am particularly passionate about advancing medical imaging, organ matching, and clinical diagnostics through interpretable and data-driven methods.</p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">Throughout my graduate studies, I’ve contributed to diverse research projects—from supervised and unsupervised NLP model development at NASA, to protein folding analysis using knot theory, to deep learning approaches for crystallographic image classification. My work bridges applied computation with foundational statistical theory.</p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">Please feel free to explore my website to learn more about my research and professional journey. If you'd like to connect or collaborate, don’t hesitate to reach out through the <a href="contact.html">contact</a> page.</p>
